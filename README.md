# PythonNumericalMethod_Solutions
This repo contains the solutions for the book [Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientists](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html). I am still working on the solutions, and will add them soon. 

If you find there are any problems or issues, feel free to send me an email to kongqk@berkeley.edu.
